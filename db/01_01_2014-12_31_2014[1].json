[edit] i guess my explanation wasn't sufficient.  my assumption is that a circle is 'normally' in the x-y plane with a normal vector of (0  0  1) - 1 in the z direction.  if a point on the circumference is needed the point is defined by:         where   is the radius    and   are the   and   coordinates of the center of the circle  and   is the angle from a vector through the circle's center point and parallel with the x-axis.    now  if the circle doesn't have a normal vector pointing along the z-axis but  instead  is some arbitrary (x  y  z) vector  how do i find that same point?

However  different apps send different numbers of requests per second depending on how frequently they save objects or issue queries. We estimate that the average app's active user will issue 10 requests. Thus  if you had a million users on a particular day  and their traffic was evenly spread throughout the day  you could estimate your app would need about 10 000 000 total API requests  or about 120 requests per second.

		"content": "<p>This is a surprisingly deep question. The Java Language Specification <a href=\\",
		"text": " this is a surprisingly deep question. the java language specification  writes :    an instance method   declared in or inherited by class    overrides from   another method   declared in class    iff all of the following are true:       the signature of   is a subsignature (§8.4.2) of the signature of  .    ...       and :        two methods or constructors    and    have the same signature if they have the same name  the same type parameters (if any) (§8.4.4)  and  after adapting the formal parameter types of   to the the type parameters of    the same formal parameter types.      this is clearly not true in our case  as   declares a type parameter  but   does not.        the signature of a method   is a subsignature of the signature of a method   if either:              has the same signature as    or     the signature of   is the same as the erasure (§4.6) of the signature of  .          the spec explains the need for that second condition as follows:        the notion of subsignature is designed to express a relationship between two methods whose signatures are not identical  but in which one may override the other. specifically  it allows a method whose signature does not use generic types to override any generified version of that method. this is important so that library designers may freely generify methods independently of clients that define subclasses or subinterfaces of the library.       and indeed  that second condition is met in our case  as   has the signature    which also is the erasure of the signature of  .    that leaves the matter of the different return type. the spec  writes :        if a method declaration   with return type   overrides or hides the declaration of another method   with return type    then   must be return-type-substitutable (§8.4.5) for    or a compile-time error occurs.        and :        a method declaration d1 with return type r1 is return-type-substitutable for another method d2 with return type r2 iff any of the following is true:             ...       if r1 is a reference type then one of the following is true:             r1  adapted to the type parameters of d2 (§8.4.4)  is a subtype of r2.       r1 can be converted to a subtype of r2 by unchecked conversion (§5.1.9).       d1 does not have the same signature as d2 (§8.4.2)  and r1 = |r2|.                in our case  r1 = string and r2 = t. the first condition is therefore false  as string is not a subtype of t. however  string may be converted to t by unchecked conversion  making the second condition true.     the spec explains the need for the second and third conditions as follows:        an unchecked conversion is allowed in the definition  despite being unsound  as a special allowance to allow smooth migration from non-generic to generic code. if an unchecked conversion is used to determine that r1 is return-type-substitutable for r2  then r1 is necessarily not a subtype of r2 and the rules for overriding (§8.4.8.3  §9.4.1) will require a compile-time unchecked warning.       that is  your code is accepted by the compiler because you inadvertently use two compiler features introduced to ease transition to generics by permitting a step by step generification of existing code. these features open a loop hole in the compile time type system  which may cause heap pollution and weird classcastexceptions in lines that may not even feature a cast in the source code. to alert you to this danger  the compiler is required to emit an unchecked warning. these features should therefore only be used for their intended purpose (compatiblity with non-generic legacy code)  and otherwise avoided.

Nothing is displayed on the screen when clicking the button I was wondering if someone could help me find a solution. </p>\\n\\n<p>This is the button code:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<pre><code> ChooseButton1.addMouseListener(new MouseAdapter() {\\n            @Override\\n            public void mouseClicked(MouseEvent e) {\\n                ChooseButton1MouseClicked(e);\\n            }\\n        });\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>This is the method where actions are implemented:</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>private void ChooseButton1MouseClicked(MouseEvent e) {\\n\\n    JFileChooser fileChooser = new JFileChooser();\\n    int returnValue = fileChooser.showOpenDialog(null);\\n    if (returnValue == JFileChooser.APPROVE_OPTION) \\n    {\\n    File selectedFile = fileChooser.getSelectedFile();\\n    System.out.println(selectedFile.getName());\\n    }\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>Here is test code:</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>import java.awt.event.*;\\nimport javax.swing.*;\\nimport javax.swing.GroupLayout;\\nimport java.io.*;\\n\\npublic class Test extends JPanel {\\n\\nprivate JButton ChooseButton;\\n\\npublic Test() {\\n    initComponents();\\n}\\n\\nprivate void ChooseButtonActionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {\\n    JFileChooser fileChooser = new JFileChooser();\\n    int returnValue = fileChooser.showOpenDialog(null);\\n    if (returnValue == JFileChooser.APPROVE_OPTION)\\n    {\\n        File selectedFile = fileChooser.getSelectedFile();\\n        System.out.println(selectedFile.getName());\\n    }\\n}\\n\\nprivate void initComponents() {\\n\\n    ChooseButton = new JButton();\\n\\n\\n    setBorder(new javax.swing.border.CompoundBorder(\\n                                                           new javax.swing.border.TitledBorder(new javax.swing.border.EmptyBorder(0  0  0  0) \\n            \\",

In general databases excel at this type of problem in which there is large amounts of data that needs to be filtered and searched. My first guess is that you are not using MySQL indexes correctly.

		"text": " i need to transfer data from an android phone to a csr8670 development board  but i am beginner in bluetooth  android as well as csr chip programming  using what rudimentary knowledge that i have regarding bluetooth  i used this code to connect the phone to the csr board  and it seems to work smoothly up to the pairing step. here is the mainactivity file:           the interface has a single button  which when pressed  will:        check if bluetoothadapter is present     start an intent to enable bluetooth   get a list of paired devices (for simplicity i make sure that every time this has to be done  the csr board is the only device around  and make sure that it has not been paired yet)     start device discovery        the broadcastreceiver called mreceiver will look for devices being discovered. for simplicity  only one device will be discoverable (the csr board) and it will always be unpaired when discovered.      in the onreceive() function  the code           will get csr board into  . device.createbond(); will pair the phone with the csr board. after pairing is complete  a bluetoothsocket is created from device  using           connection with this socket is established using           after getting the input and output stream  i send a large number of bytes in this way:           if i do this  a certain number of bytes gets detected by the csr board and the detected bytes are shown on the screen in the csr board's ide  a larger number of bytes simply get detected but do not get displayed (i think this has something to do with how fast the csr board can detect versus how fast the phone is sending the byte stream) and many of them just get lost. if i don't send a large continuous byte stream and just a single byte  it just seems to get lost.      later on i tried to see if i could get the bluechat sample program from android to detect the csr board. the program works fine upto the device discovery phase  but some reason i still cannot find which part of the bluechat sample program does the pairing ( see my question here ). the device.createbond() function does not seem to be present in the bluechat sample program (the sdk ide does not show it after the dot  which is another weirdness i haven't understood yet)  but i managed to get the paring done using method class. the main changes are in connectthread constructor of the connect thread class:           the rest of the bluechat code is mostly untouched  except for the custom uuid and logcat entries. if i run this program now  all the messages sent from the phone seem to get properly detected and displayed by the csr board and none of the data is lost.      what  exactly is the difference between my code and the bluechat sample program  that the send data gets lost in my program while it doesn't in the bluechat sample? as far as i understand it  it's not possible to reduce baud rate for bluetooth rfcomm  so the bluechat program cannot be sending data at a lower speed. also  how exactly does the bluechat pair with another phone? when working with two android phones  the bluechat sample works out-of-the-box without any modifications  but i can't understand how it is doing the actual pairing part.      i will be happy to provide any extra information.

(all open connections to it's source). if the ref count is 0 then it turns gps off.    this means that you can't have a true proxy though  as the end user will have to call open/close. don't use finalize for this as this can lead to unforseen consequences. (don't trust on garbage collector for timing of your reference counter).    if you have to use the gps interface purely (cannot extend it with open/close / addref/removeref) then you can also guess at it  and have each proxy keep a 'lastaccessed' timer which when expired  closes / drops it reference count and when activated increases the ref count again) however this will always be a tradeof (sometimes your code will wrongly guess it's not used)    anyways in all regards  the pattern to use would be proxy i suspect.

		"text": " i  love  java 8 streams. they are intuitive  powerful and elegant. but they do have one major drawback imo: they make debugging much harder (unless you can solve your problem by just debugging lambda expressions  which is answered  here ).    consider the following two equivalent fragments:         and         i find the first one much clearer and more succinct. however consider the situation in which the result is not what you were expecting. what do you do?     in the traditional iterative style  you put a breakpoint on the   line and step through each value in the list. you can see what the current list element is (watch n)  the current total (watch totalbitcount) and  depending on the debugger  what the return value of integer.bitcount is.     in the new stream style all of this is impossible. you can put a breakpoint on the entire statement and step through to the   method. but in general this is close to useless. in this situation in my test my call stack was 11 deep of which 10 were java.util methods that i had no interest in. it is impossible to step through the code testing predicates or performing the mapping.     it is noted in the answers to  debugging streams question  that iteractive debuggers work fairly well for breaking inside lambda expressions (such as the   predicate). but in many situations the most appropriate breakpoint is not within a lambda.    clearly this is a simple piece of code to debug. but once custom reductions and collections are added  or more complex chains of filters and maps  it can become a nightmare to debug.    i have tried this on netbeans and eclipse and both seem to have the same issues.    over the last few months i've got used to debugging using .peek calls to log interim values or moving interim steps into their own named methods or  in extreme cases  refactoring as iteration until any bugs are sorted out. this works but it reminds me a lot of the bad old days before modern ides with integrated interactive debuggers when you had to scatter printf statements through code.    surely there's a better way.    specifically i would like to know:      have others experienced this same issue?   are there any 'stream aware' interactive debuggers available?   are there better techniques for debugging this style of code?   is this a reason to restrict the use of streams to simple cases?      any techniques that you have found successful would be much appreciated.

		"content": "<p>You don't actually need a separate LinkedList class; the ListNode class <strong>is</strong> a linked list. Or  to state it differently  a reference to the head of the list is a reference to the list.</p>\\n\\n<p>The use of head  tail  current  prev in the sample code you posted has come from a double-linked list which is a data type that has links in both directions. This is more efficient for certain types of applications (such as finding the nth last item).</p>\\n\\n<p>So I would recommend renaming your ListNode class to LinkedList and renaming <code>next</code> to <code>tail</code>.</p>\\n\\n<p>To add a new item to the list you need a method that creates a new list with the new item at it's head. Here is an example:</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>class LinkedList&lt;E&gt; {\\n    ...\\n\\n    private LinkedList(E value  LinkedList&lt;E&gt; tail) {\\n        this.data = value;\\n        this.tail = tail;\\n    }\\n\\n    public LinkedList&lt;E&gt; prependItem(E item) {\\n        return new LinkedList(item  this);\\n    }\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>Then to add a new item <code>i</code> to <code>list</code> you use <code>list = list.prependItem(i);</code></p>\\n\\n<p>If for some reason you need to always add the items to the end  then:</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>private LinkedList(E value) {\\n    this.data = value;\\n    this.tail = null;\\n}\\n\\npublic void appendItem(E item) {\\n    LinkedList&lt;E&gt; list = this;\\n    while (list.tail != null)\\n        list = list.tail;\\n    list.tail = new LinkedList&lt;&gt;(item);\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>However this is obviously pretty inefficient for long lists. If you need to do this then either use a different data structure or just reverse the list when you have finished adding to it.</p>\\n\\n<p>Incidentally  an interesting side effect of this is that a reference to any item in the list is a reference to a linked list. This makes recursion very easy. For example  here's a recursive solution for finding the length of a list:</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>public int getLength(LinkedList list) {\\n    if (list == null) {\\n        return 0;\\n    } else {\\n        return 1 + getLength(list.getTail());\\n    }\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>And using this a simple (but very inefficient!) solution to the problem you provided - I've renamed the method to make its function more obvious:</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>public LinkedList getTailOfListOfLengthN(LinkedList list  int n) {\\n    int length = getLength(list);\\n    if (length &lt; n) {\\n        return null;\\n    } else if (length == n) {\\n        return list;\\n    } else {\\n        return getTailOfLengthN(list.getTail()  n);\\n    }\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>And to reverse the list:</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>public LinkedList&lt;E&gt; reverse() {\\n    if (tail == null) {\\n        return this;\\n    } else {\\n        LinkedList&lt;E&gt; list = reverse(tail);\\n        tail.tail = this;\\n        tail = null;\\n        return list;\\n    }\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>As I hope you can see this makes the methods a lot more elegant than separating the node list classes.</p>\\n",

		"text": "    hibernate tries to defer the persistence context flushing up until the last possible moment. this strategy has been traditionally known as  transactional write-behind .    the write-behind is more related to hibernate flushing rather than any logical or physical transaction. during a transaction  the flush may occur multiple times.    the flushed changes are visible only for the current database transaction. until the current transaction is committed  no change is visible by other concurrent transactions.     the  identity generator  allows an integer/bigint column to be auto-incremented on demand. the increment process happens outside of the current running transaction  so a roll-back may end-up discarding already assigned values (value gaps may happen).     the increment process is very efficient since it uses a database internal lightweight locking mechanism as opposed to the more heavyweight transactional course-grain locks.     the only drawback is that we can’t know the newly assigned value prior to executing the insert statement. this restriction is hindering the “transactional write behind” flushing strategy adopted by hibernate. for this reason hibernates disables the jdbc batch support for entities using the identity generator.     the solution is to use a table identifier generator  backed by a  pooled-lo optimizer . this generator works with mysql too  so it overcomes the lack of database sequence support. just make sure you enable the new enhanced identifier hibernate configuration. if you haven't deployed your app into production  then you need to regenerate all entities keys  which is possible with this identifier. just use the associated identifier sequence table for that  so new entities know what sequence number to start from.

(we will verify this with a test program below).    you might think now that a cpu has fpus with 80 bits mantisse  that is right  and behavior is very situation and hardware dependent  i think. chances are that it gets rounded to 52 bits of precision.      extra check  using a test program to produce the ieee 754 representation in memory:  ow doing it with the computer gives this as result which is perfectly in agreement with what i did by hand:         indeed: the last three bits are different.

(this assumes you have  already created the project files .) in my case  e.g. for cordova command line interface  i used terminal    to my project's root directory and then type:         for your phonegap setup  you will likely need to do  one of the following :     add this to your project's config.xml file.           or   (for phonegap cli)  type this command into terminal from your project's root directory           once you have the plugin  you can use javascript to control admob behavior.     step 2 : add appropriate javascript for admob plugin to your project  linked in your index.html file. i ran into some trouble here  so just to prove to myself that the plugin really works  i removed (backed up) everything from my project's www folder and added the exact files from the www folder from  this project  and later  this one  on github. both work. it was then a matter of making smarter-people-than-myself's javascript work in my app.     a few tips       don't use the emulator. admob may not perform correctly in the emulator.    for some reason  i am not served admob ads over lte/4g. if you are certain you have done everthing correctly  try connecting your device to wifi when testing    if your app is still not working  and you don't know what elese to do  try to  validate your html . invalid html will affect performance of javascript.   make sure you have added   in your head of your index file.

(base inputs in range 2-9 and 16 will not go in the return -1 if block) gayle  the author later summarized that it's better to write code that is more flexible and general-purpose which i would agree with and is the reasoning behind my argument for the allowance of 11-15 base inputs.  say if you're working with base 11. i believe converttobase should still work for this because you're counting to 'a' which should still work behind the logic(range 'a' to 'f') in digittovalue. is there a reason why she disallowed those inputs?
